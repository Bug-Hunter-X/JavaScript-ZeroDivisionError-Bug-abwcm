# JavaScript ZeroDivisionError Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: division by zero. The `bug.js` file contains a function `foo` that attempts to divide `a` by `b`. If `b` is zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` will be thrown, unless both `a` and `b` are zero.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the function that handles this edge case gracefully.
